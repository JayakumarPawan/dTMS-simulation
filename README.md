# Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stiumlation (dTMS) simulator

A MatLab environment configured for simulating electric and magnetic fields produced by alternating current carrying coils specialy dessigned for brain stimulation. The files contain a professionaly developed down to the neuron level modeling of the brain as well as sample coil designs. The magnetic field create was calculated using bio-savart's law and finite element analysis. 

This software was developed as part of a bigger project on desiging novel coil designs for dTMS, which is a non-invasive procedure which stimulates the brain to correct psyciatric disorders such as bi-polar disesase.
